	<h1>Similiraties in different programming languages </h1>
	<p>I have only done about two programming language.That is not alot considering i want to learn as many as i can.Morever  i want to d
	more than learn, I aslo want to become a master at these programming languages.</p>
	<p>With the little knowledge and the shallow experience i have now , i can say that programming is easy at the same time very hard .Well everything will always be if you have a bad attitude.Learnign a your first language is hard but after you finish your first language the ease of learning other langu
	languages increase.This is because most of the programming language are amost similar in syntax and  reserved names.Moreveer computer scientist continue working 
	on making languages more close to our natural languages.</p>
